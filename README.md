# Event Driven Architecture With Event Bridge

## Let's setup the services required for this project

## Launch the AWS CloudFormation template

We can run this project inside your AWS account. To follow along with this project we need to make sure that we have setup the required numbers of services and provisioned them.

You can select your preferred region and cost may vary according to the region you choose.For this project i have used "Asia Pacific (Singapore)
ap-southeast-1".

The link to above region is mentioned below :

[Link to Singapore Region](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=ap-southeast-1#/stacks/quickcreate?stackName=aws-event-driven-architectures-workshop&templateURL=https://aws-event-driven-architecture-workshop-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/master-v2.yaml)

We need to follow the following steps to configure our prerequisites services/resources:

1. Enter a stack name 

2. Check the boxes in the Capabilities section

3. Click Create stack

Now we need to configure our Event Generator this process is called as Event Generation.

Event Generation: An event is generated by an application or service within the AWS infrastructure. This could be a user action within a web application, a change in the state of a resource in AWS, or a message in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue.

# Event Generator setup

## Configure the Event Generator

Once the stack creation has been completed navigate to the stack Outputs tab. Here you will find all the values necessary to configure the Event Generator to work with your account.

1. EventGeneratorConfigurationUrl - this url will pre-populate the Event Generator with all the settings you need.

2. CognitoPassword - your password for logging into the Event Generator

3. CognitoUsername - your user name (defaults to "user")

4. Right-click the url in the EventGeneratorConfigurationUrl output, opening a new browser window.

5. This will open the Event Generator website and pre-populate the modal dialog box with values for a Cognito User Pool and Cognito Identity Pool provisioned in your AWS account. Click Configure Cognito User Pool to view the sign-in page.

6. On the Sign In page add your the CognitoUsername and CognitoPassword from the CloudFormation Stack Output page.

7. Click the Sign In button.

8. After successful sign in, you verify that the Cognito user has been configured and that your account id has been pre-populated in the AWS Account ID field.

Till now we have successfully configured our Event Generator.Now, our real project begins from here.

let us know bit about the Event-Bridge

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from your own applications, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services and routes that data to targets such as AWS Lambda. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real time to all of your data sources.
